# static-jsx

static-jsx is an extremely simple, dependency-free JSX runtime which renders JSX
directly to raw HTML strings. It is intended to be used to power a static HTML
template engine, closer to something like Handlebars, Nunjucks, etc. than React.

## Usage

TODO: usage with Babel, TypeScript, Deno, etc.
